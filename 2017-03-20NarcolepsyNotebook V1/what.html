                <h2>What is Narcolepsy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Narcolepsy is a neurological condition that causes patients to have excessive sleepiness during the day combined with recurring episodes of naps, particularly at inappropriate times. Narcoleptics usually first complain of feeling sleepy or tired all the time. Consequently, sufferers tend to fall asleep during the situations when most people would remain awake, like watching an exciting movie or driving. Narcolepsy can be an extremely dangerous disorder, primarily because the narcoleptic falls asleep at inappropriate times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Narcoleptics usually experience one or more of the following four symptoms: excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Symptoms can appear all at once or develop slowly over many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cataplexy is a temporary decrease or complete loss of muscle control triggered by a strong emotion such as laughing, anger, or surprise. It can range from a weakness in the knees to a complete “rag doll” collapse to the ground. Patients, while essentially paralyzed, are fully conscious during these attacks. The frequency of cataplexy attacks varies by patient, but they usually do not last more than a few minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Narcoleptics may also suffer from sleep paralysis, a brief loss of muscle control that occurs as they are drifting to sleep or awakening. While somewhat aware of the surroundings, patients are unable to move or speak. Paralysis usually disappears when the person is touched. Forty to 65% of narcoleptics experience sleep paralysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vivid dream-like images and sounds experienced at sleep onset, called hypnagogic hallucinations, may also affect a person with narcolepsy. These visions can be very frightening because the person is partially awake, but unable to control the event. Emotions that usually accompany these images are fear, anxiety, and dread. Hypnagogic hallucinations affect between 50 to 70% of narcoleptic patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another symptom of narcolepsy may include automatic behavior, or performing tasks and activities without recollection of the event. Essentially, it is a “black out” during wakefulness; the person may actually be asleep with his or her eyes open. Repeated nighttime awakenings, double vision, trouble concentrating, and memory loss are also common symptoms of narcolepsy.
                </p>
                <h2>How Is Narcolepsy Treated?</h2>
                <p>
                    Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, treatment options are available to help reduce the various symptoms. Treatment is individualized depending on the severity of the symptoms, and it may take weeks or months for an optimal regimen to be worked out. Complete control of sleepiness and cataplexy is rarely possible. Treatment is primarily by medications, but lifestyle changes are also important. The main treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy is with a group of drugs called central nervous system stimulants. For cataplexy and other REM-sleep symptoms, antidepressant medications and other drugs that suppress REM sleep are prescribed. Caffeine and over-the-counter drugs have not been shown to be effective and are not recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to drug therapy, an important part of treatment is scheduling short naps (10 to 15 minutes) two to three times per day to help control excessive daytime sleepiness and help the person stay as alert as possible. Daytime naps are not a replacement for nighttime sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ongoing communication among the physician, the person with narcolepsy, and family members about the response to treatment is necessary to achieve and maintain the best control.
