                    <h2>Kirk Watkins, MD, DABSM</h2>
                    <p class="aboutText">Dr. Watkins attended medical school at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. Little did he know that while attending he suffered from Narcolepsy. Even with the challenges this undiagnosed disorder presented he was still able to graduate near the top of his class. Initially he started his practise in primary care but came to love the field of sleep medicine. The irony of the situation is that he was only diagnosed with Narcolepsy years after he shifted his practice to a full-time sleep medicine center. Dr. Watkins will be providing the majority of the video blog content for the site.</p>

                    <h2>Parker Watkins, RPSGT, RST</h2>
                    <p class="aboutText">Parker also carries a diagnosis of Narcolepsy but has been one of the lucky few that was diagnosed early in life. Ironically, he also works at a sleep clinic and the his credentials stand for Registered Polysomnographic Technologist (RPSGT) and Registered Sleep Technician (RST). Parker is the developer of the site and will also create blog post as time permits.</p>

                    <img src="/pics/karston.jpg" alt="Karston">
                    <h2>Karston Watkins</h2>
                    <p class="aboutText">Karston is another member of our team with Narcolepsy, though his path to diagnosis was far more difficult and painful than his other team members. Currently Karston is attempting to build a motivational marketing business and will fill that role perfectly for us as he will be posting motivational video's and blog posts.</p>
